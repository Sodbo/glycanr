Description: Useful utilities in N-glycan data analysis. This package tries
	to fill the gap in N-glycan data analysis by providing easy
	to use functions for glycomics analysis
	(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycomics for more
	 details on Glycomics). At the moment glycanr is mostly oriented 
	to data obtained by UPLC and LCMS analysis of Plasma and IgG glycome.
