# Introduction

Glycomics is rapidly emerging field in high-throughput biology that
aims to systematically study glycan structures of a given protein, cell type or
organic system. As within other high-throughput methods in biology (microarrays,
metabolomics, proteomics), accuracy of high-throughput methods is highly affected
by complicated experimental procedures leading to differences between replicates
and the existence of batch effects, among others.

***Glycanr*** package tries to fill the gap in N-glycan data analysis by providing
easy to use functions for glycomics analysis. At the moment it is mostly
oriented to data obtained by UPLC and LCMS analysis of Plasma and IgG
glycome.

## Targeted audience

As commented, the package is currently oriented to data analysts working
with Plasma and IgG glycome data obtained by UPLC and LCMS analysis.
More correctly, it is oriented to the analysts with the data resembling
data from papers like
[Selman et al.][1],
[Pučić et al.][2] or
[Stöckmann et al.][3].

The package helps in calculating different quantities like derived traits
and preparing the data for analysts wishing to do different statistical
or computational modelling of the N-glycan data like in
[Vučković et al.][4], [Krištić et al][5] or
[Barrios et al.][6].
